## Predictive Model for early indicators of CKD

Chronic kidney disease(CKD), is a long-term condition that involves a gradual loss of kidney function. CKD has varying levels of seriousness and there are usually no symptoms of the disease in its early stages.  The condition gets worse over time, though treatment has been shown to slow progression. If left untreated, CKD can progress to kidney failure and early cardiovascular disease. When the kidneys stop working, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed for survival.
	
Machine learning models can be useful in detecting early indicators of kidney damage and thereby facilitate disease prevention, assist with early planning of renal replacement therapy, and offer potential clinical and economic benefits to patients and health systems.
