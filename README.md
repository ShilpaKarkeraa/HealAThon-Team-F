Chronic kidney disease(CKD), is a long-term condition that involves a gradual loss of kidney function. CKD has varying levels of seriousness and there are usually no symptoms of the disease in its early stages.  The condition gets worse over time, though treatment has been shown to slow progression. If left untreated, CKD can progress to kidney failure and early cardiovascular disease. When the kidneys stop working, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed for survival.
	
Through various Machine learning models it is possible to predict early indicators of kidney damage and thereby facilitate disease prevention, assist with early planning of renal replacement therapy, and offer potential clinical and economic benefits to patients and health systems. Our project makes use of four Machine Learning models DecisionTreeClassifier, Logistic Regresssion, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost to find the correlation between various sample parameters and their effect on CKD.
